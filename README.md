# My Power BI Learning Path

This course was a full journey into Business Intelligence with a strong focus on how **Power BI** fits into the process. We started by understanding the BI flow, getting data, transforming it, modeling, analyzing, then visualizing and sharing it.

## Course Overview

The course gave a complete overview of building professional Power BI reports from start to finish.

We explored different Power BI tools like **Desktop**, **Service**, **Report Server**, also **Mobile** and **Embedded** options. Most work was done in Power BI Desktop, where we created and analyzed reports.

- We used **Power Query (M language)** to connect to different sources like Excel, CSV, SQL Server, APIs, and web pages, applying basic transformations and custom columns.
    
- For modeling, we built **star schemas** and created hierarchies to organize the data and improve performance ,explored the differences between it and snowflake model 
    
- Using **DAX**, we calculated key metrics and learned how to handle row context, filter context, and context transition, especially with `CALCULATE`.
    
- Visuals were carefully designed with good chart choices, colors, and layouts, and we added interactions like drill down, drill through, tooltips, and bookmarks.
    
- We published reports to both **Power BI Service** and **Report Server**, tried different **connectivity modes** (Import, DirectQuery, Live), and practiced collaboration and feedback.
